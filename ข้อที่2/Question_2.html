  <p>My name is Supawit Charoenwetch. Just call me "Jia".</p>
  <main>
    I am a graduated digital media student from Prince of Songkla University International College, Hatyai, Thailand.
    Creativity is the key that I use to drive my life. I love to create meaningful and productive project. 
    Furthermore, I extremely enjoy working as a team because the energetic atmosphere and idea-sharing are the best parts of my working life. 
    Previously, most of my projects were animations and films. However, my interest changed to the technology-business industry, 
    hence, presently, I am self-studying about web-development, both in front and back ends sections. 
    By combining imagination and technology knowledge, I intend to achieve my life goal which is to create an efficiency solution for the problem of our society.
